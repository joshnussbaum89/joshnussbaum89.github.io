<p>Hi there, thank you for visiting!</p>

<p>I've spent my entire life, as a musician, creating things that mean a lot to me. I know what
it means to put your heart and soul into something and really connect with another human being.</p>

<p>Just as I have accomplished with music, I am commited to becoming as meaningful creater as a
Web Developer. I hope to build tools and applications that are not only ethical, but fun to use. I believe we are seeing a turning point that will welcome so many more people into the tech space, and I am so excited to be a part of that space.</p>

<p>Please feel free to reach out at any time. I'm always looking for new people to collaborate with, and learn from.</p>
